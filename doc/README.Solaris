This file describes how to configure pam_hbac for access control on a
Solaris machine.

Please note that pam_hbac developers tested pam_hbac on Solaris 11. On a
different Solaris distribution, some parts of the instructions (especially
installing dependencies) might differ.

Prerequisities
==============
Please make sure your Solaris client is able to resolve and authenticate
the IPA or AD users. For example, for users coming from an AD trust:
    $ id administrator@win.trust.test
    $ su - administrator@win.trust.test
A good starting point for this configuration is to read:
    https://www.freeipa.org/page/ConfiguringUnixClients

Building from source
====================
Please make sure all required dependencies are installed. On Solaris 11,
this would be:
    pkg install autoconf libtool pkg-config automake gcc asciidoc docbook
on Omnios:
    pkg install developer/build/autoconf \
                developer/build/libtool \
                developer/pkg-config \
                developer/build/automake \
                developer/gcc48 \
                system/header \
                developer/object-file \
                developer/linker
on Solaris 10:
    pkgutil -i pkgconfig gmake libglib2_dev asciidoc autoconf automake gcc4core glib2 libtool

Note: Since Solaris 10 doesn't have a lot of this packages available easily, you can use
the free packages located here: https://www.opencsw.org/.  The pkgutil application will
take care of installing all the dependencies for you. If you don't have internet access
on the system you are building PAM module on then you can optionally create a package
stream file on an internet facing system and then install the packages manually from that
single file.
To build the stream file you can use a command like this:
pkgutil -s -o pam_hbac_build_tools.pkg -y -d pkgconfig gmake libglib2_dev asciidoc \
                                             autoconf automake gcc4core glib2 libtool
Then just follow the instructions that follow from the creation of the file.

On Solaris, the third-party PAM modules are normally located in
/usr/lib/security. When building from source, you'll want to add:
    --with-pammoddir=/usr/lib/security
to the configure invocation. In addition, please specify the location where
you want to read pam_hbac the config file from with --sysconfdir, like this:
    --sysconfdir=/etc/
Then pam_hbac will read its configuration from /etc/pam_hbac.conf.
In addition, specify the correct manual pages directory for Solaris:
    --mandir=/usr/share/man

Finally, run the configure script:
    $ ./configure \
            --with-pammoddir=/usr/lib/security \
            --mandir=/usr/share/man

SSL/TLS
=======
The SSL/TLS configuration depends on what exact flavor and version of Solaris
are you running. The modern Solaris releases, such as Solaris 11 already ship
with OpenLDAP libraries, which allow the SSL_PATH option to point to a
certificate file. The older Solaris releases and derivatives such as Omnios
need to put the IPA certs to a NSS database and put the path to a directory that
contains the NSS database as the value of the SSL_PATH option.

You can tell whether your OS supports certificate files by checkig the configure
output for the presence of the ldap_start_tls function. If this function is found,
then the OpenLDAP libraries on your system support certificate files.

Configuration
=============
You need to configure the module itself, then include the module in the
PAM stack. Please see the pam_hbac.conf(5) man page for the available
configuration options.

Note: For Solaris 10, make sure to define the "SSL_PATH" option in the
pam_hbac.conf file as by default Solaris 10 does not have OpenLDAP installed.
Example:  SSL_PATH = /var/ldap

When the config file is created, put the following into /etc/pam.d/other
or just the particular PAM service you would like to control access to:
    account    required    pam_hbac.so    ignore_unknown_user ignore_authinfo_unavail

Adding the option `ignore_unknown_user` is important on Solaris for the same
reason Linux systems normally use `pam_localuser.so` - pam_hbac looks up
accounts using NSS calls and a failure to look up a user would deny access,
because no rules would apply. Additionally, pam_hbac returns PAM_UNKNOWN_USER
for root, which might e impractical if you decide to put the module into
the system-wide configuration.

Similarly, adding the `ignore_authinfo_unavail` option is handy in case
the LDAP server is not reachable. In that case, pam_hbac would return
PAM_IGNORE and proceed with the rest of the stack instead of a hard error.

Before making any changes to the PAM stack, please make sure to have a root
console open until you finish testing of pam_hbac setup, to make sure you
don't lock yourself out of the system!
